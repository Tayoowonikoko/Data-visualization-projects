## ✨ Key Insights
📊 From the dashboard analysis:  

- **Price vs. Bedrooms**:  
  - Average **price increases with the number of bedrooms** (larger properties cost more per night).  
  - However, demand drops for larger properties, making them less profitable overall.  

- **Revenue by Bedrooms**:  
  - **Single-bedroom properties generate the highest overall revenue** due to strong demand.  
  - Revenue **decreases steadily** as the number of bedrooms increases.  

- **Monthly Revenue Trends**:  
  - **December is the most profitable month** of the year, reflecting peak holiday demand.  
  - **Summer months (June–August)** also show strong performance.  
  - **January has the lowest revenue**, indicating it is the off-season.  

- **Listings Distribution**:  
  - The majority of Airbnb properties are concentrated in the 1–2 bedroom segment.  
  - Higher-bedroom properties are fewer in number but priced significantly higher, with lower occupancy.

## 💡 Recommendations for Investors
- **Property Type Focus**:  
  Invest in **single-bedroom properties**, which combine affordability, high demand, and strong revenue potential.  

- **Seasonality Strategy**:  
  - Optimize pricing during **December and summer months** to capture peak demand.  
  - Offer competitive pricing or promotions in **January** to maintain occupancy in the low season.  

- **Diversification**:  
  Consider a mix of **1–2 bedroom properties** for steady, year-round revenue while avoiding overexposure to larger, less profitable listings.  

- **Location Targeting**:  
  Use postcode-level insights to prioritize areas with consistently higher average prices and strong seasonal booking activity.
